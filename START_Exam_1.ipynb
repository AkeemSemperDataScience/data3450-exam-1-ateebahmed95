Fully furnished units have the highest average price per square foot at approximately 1,923 AED, followed by unfurnished units at around 1,558 AED, and partially furnished units at about 1,430 AED. This suggests that furnishing has a strong influence on price per square foot, with fully furnished properties generally commanding higher prices. The standard deviations indicate that there is some variability within each group, but the overall trend is clear the more complete furnishing is associated with higher price per square foot."

Since this is greater than the required threshold of 329 good days, we can conclude that the store is likely to be profitable within its first year.
